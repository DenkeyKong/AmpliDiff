# AmpliDiff

This repository contains the code for [AmpliDiff](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.22.550164v1), a Python tool that finds amplicons and corresponding primers in viral genomes in order to differentiate between different lineages/strains/species.

### Requirements
All dependencies can be found in the dependencies.txt files in the corresponding folders. As of now, AmpliDiff relies on [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com) to perform primer optimization.

AmpliDiff has not been tested on Windows systems.
